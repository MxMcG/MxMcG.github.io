    <h2>Getting in Position</h2>
    <h3>CSS positioning, uses and information</h3>

      <p class="blog-post-p1">Creating a website is a very design-intensive process. The more thought put into a well-planned design, the more a site will appeal to users and gain traction. CSS, short for cascading style sheets it the name for the mechanism used by programmers to style their content on websites and applications. CSS is organized and stored onto files, which are attached as links to the original index.html file where the main content of a site is stored. A huge part of styling elements on a site is positioning them in the right place with CSS. The process of positioning elements with css is definitively not quite as simple as dragging and pasting widgets onto a page, rather, positioning must be manually achieved through code in order to account for several factors and desired results. On important concept to keep in mind is that screens come in all sorts of different sizes. In learning how to position elements, keeping in mind differences in screen size will remind us why we depend on a CSS positioning for html elements.

      <p class="blog-post-p2">It is important to note the four major types of positioning in CSS: static, relative, absolute, and fixed. Positioning does not cascade to other elements in CSS files, therefore, positioning must be applied to each desired element for a specific result. By default, static is the position for every single page element. Therefore, static is not often used much, except to restore an element to default if another position such as absolute had been applied. This leaves programmers with three main postitions to work with.

      <p class="blog-post-p3">Relative positioning is a feature that allows one to postition an element relative to itself. With relative positioning, you may position an element away from where it would normally be, using the attributes, top, bottom, right and left. For example, a bottom: 30 px would move the element up that much from where it originally held place. Absolute positioning is powerful because it allows coders to position elements anywhere relative to its parent element. One big trade off with absolute positioning is that it makes the elements position unrelated to other elements which sometimes may cause conflicts because the element is removed from the flow of a page. The third major type of positioning is fixed, also the most rare. Fixed position elements are fixed relative to the viewport, or browser window. Fixed elements ignore the scroll feature of sites in that they go along with a page like a sticker. This is rarely used because of overlap issues. Absolute and relative positioning are the most commonly used positioning features because they are dynamic and quite useful in styleing with css. Now, go try it out for yourself in a stylesheet near you!
