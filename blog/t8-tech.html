        I remember the very first time I sat down to try and understand how to develop my own websites. At the time, I was halfway through college and attempting to start up my own ticket exchange website with a few college friends. As the proccess of prototyping and developing ideas for how the site might look went on and on, I realized that I inevitably needed to learn how to actually code. The first resource that I found to learn about coding was a website called One Month Rails. This course essentially was a one month guide for creating a basic web app in a short period of time. I was very unfamiliar with all aspects of my computer at the time and I clearly remeber just about every aspect of the lessons to be extremely new and confusing to me. At first, I had no idea what a text editor or even the terminal were, but as I became introduced to the Rails framework, things really started to all come together.

        Rails is a relatively new open source web framework that uses our familiar Ruby programming language. Rails is well known for its overriding principles called "Convention over Configuration", "Don't repeat yourself", and "Restful web services". Rails is a popular framework because it enables rapid development. The framework is set up so that developers may write less code and do not have to write uneccesary code. In addition, there are many implicit behaviors that are defined within the framework that you do not have to specify, as they are already defined by the rails framework. This is very beneficial because it enables us to create more efficient code that is not redundant and bulky. There are a wide varitey of third party ruby gems that can help an application in many different ways. Rails is being used more and more by large companies and startups because of its effective nature.

        Many noteable companies such as Twitter use rails for their web applications. In terms of security, rails works like any other framework and the usual processes of code review, penetration testing, static analysis are all needed in the development process. Rails provides some support to provide security for users, however, it needs to be kept up to date against security vulnerabilities. Getting started with Ruby on Rails is a great investment/ The Ruby on Rails official guides are a great tool to understand the basics of the framework. In terms of understanding security on Rails apps, Rails provides a basic security guide to understand how to handle these issues. I think that choosing to learn Rails will be one of the best decisions I have made thus far. Ruby has a ton of online resources to assist with building skills.
