        Some Values that I think of when I have felt the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied in my life are: Adventure, Affection, Close relationships, community, creativity, excitement, faith, music, nature, wisdom, tranquility.

        In General, I try to live up to these values: 3.5 agree.

        The value I have choosen is excitement. I think that for me, it is easy to get caught up in the routine and struggle to see excitement. Sometimes, I need something to look forward to especially when I am working very hard. Faith hads helped motivate me in times where things do not seem very exciting. It is here where I have excitement about the things to come. I think a good balance between community, close relationships and tranquality is really what I need most in my life. Right now, as I just finished school, I am seeking to be a part of a community that offers just that and build contribute myslef to a community that I care about.

        The last topic that someone asked me for advice on was something technical. I have not really had anyone ask me for advice in a while and perhaps have just been very busy lately that I have not had the time to just hang out with people or build meaningful relationships. At this transitory point in my life, many things about my future seem uncertain, so I trust that God will continue to work through me and direct me way always.

        I think when I am feeling down, it would help me play guitar or to just take a break and lay down. i am the type of person that really enjoys being out in nature and would love to partake more in outdoor activities.
