      <h2>Asking Good Questions</h2>
      <h3>Analysis of some of my own habits.</h3>

      <p class="blog-post-p1">
        After reading Stackoverflow's how to ask page, I am now more aware of how asking great questions is a crucially vital aspect of being a successful programmer. Not only does asking questions help keep a group project productive and time efficient, it also makes the process of developing well designed code more streamlined. I have not asked many technical questions thus far on our DBC google+ group, however, I think that the examples shown on a site like Stackoverflow show how good questions can be answered if asked correctly and not previously answered.

      <p class="blog-post-p2">
        In terms of asking questions about code online, I think the two most important things to keep in mind are, "Has this question been answered somewhere else online" and "How can I best format this question to make it clear and simple for people more experienced than I to answer?". Often times I find myself being a lazy researcher... using the first results that I get to implement important changes in my code. Just as in the medical profession, I think it is crucial to get second opinions about the issue you are having with your code from other devs who may have solved the issue differently.

      <p class="blog-post-p3">
        In my question asking pursuits, I strongly desire to be more slow and patient in finding anwsers. Often times I find myself rushing to fing a correct answer or make sure that everyone is happy but I think that it is important for me to focus on being calm myself. Asking questions has always been a true strength of mine, in person at least, and I think that learning how to do the same in an online context will be extremely beneficial for my future.
