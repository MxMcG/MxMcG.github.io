  <h1>Gettin' funky with Version Control</h1>
  <h2>Taming your versions of code into one cage!</h2>
  <h4>May 20th, 2015</h4>

      Ever wonder how bright young programmers located in several cities throughout the world are able to all collaborate on the same project? Version control has made this a possibility in  recent years, allowing development to transcend limitations of international borders and time! Similar to how one saves versions of an essay to a word document as they work, version control allows developers to save versions of their new code additions to a project as they go. Not only does version control allow code to be securely logged for instant future access... it allows multiple programmers to contribute to one project at once! Version Control Software such as the widely-used Git have standardized the way in which developers work together remotely on projects.

        Git's setup works like a beautiful evergreen tree, constantly growing and shooting out new branches. We may think of each branch as a different developer's contributions to the main tree trunk, called the "master" branch. The master branch is the backbone of an entire project and is what is displayed to its intended audience. Like bees bringing back new resources back to the main hive, programmers create new files, and make modifications of code on their own branches and push it to the master branch. On Git, developers are able to work at the same time on different files and then commit their changes to the mother branch called "master". It is important to note that Git allows programmers to commit their branch without immidiately altering the master branch. In what are called pull requests, programmers submit their all-ready-to-go code for review by other team developers before the changes are added to the master branch. Pull requests are a great utility, offered by Git's website-little brother named GitHub.

        Github is a revolutionary website that is essentially the social media mecca of programming. Not only are programmers able to create repositories and see their own commits, rather, this site allows users to see eachother's work in progress. GitHub is the main place where open source projects store their code to be seen by others for criticism and improvement. Also, GitHub is the main place for developers to work together on a private or public repository. By integrating Git technology into an effective website platform, GitHub has integrated all the features of Git's version control into an easy to use interface. GitHub is beneficial for working on a group coding project because it provides all the necessary tools for collaboration. Think of GitHub as an enormous forest containing millions of thriving trees of software projects. A visitor to GitHub may plant their own trees in the forest, view and take pictures of other trees, and even create private fenced off areas of trees to enjoy with more exclusive groups of tourists. Basically, there are many ways to navigate and contribute to GitHub, so I encourage all eager developers to take a walk through this forest that keeps on giving out more spectacular trees.
