      Only a mere half week into my experience at Devbootcamp, I can already tell that this experience is going to be a challenging yet ultimately fulfilling ride. Tonight I walked home from campus here at UCLA, and met up with a buddy at his apartment. We got to talking about my work thus far on Phase 0. I exclaimed, "Man... I feel that I have learned more useful skills in the past week than I have in the past two quarters of class". That is honestly how I have felt this week after learning all about the the shell and bash, Git and Github, and managing files on my computer. In his fireside chat, Karim said, "If you want to go far and fast we are going to go together... each student has a lot to learn in offering." At Devbootcamp it seems that I am entering an educational experience starkly different than my past 3 years at university. I do not wish to bash on my college degree, but the skills I am learning at Devbootcamp feel so much more real and practical than the theoretical essays and reading assignments I did for my Political Science degree.

      What I am excited about regarding the DBC is that each person walking in has a ton to offer and learn. I am relatively unfamiliar with web development and coding however, I am already seeing how my skills in other areas such as reading and writing are coming into play as I learn the basics of the command line and GitHub. Now that I have experienced the first week of curriculum, I feel comfortable and stoked to be a part of a quite alternative style of learning. Devbootcamp is really what you make of it, and the curriculum and educational framework seems to be set up to make it the easiest to put your all into what you are doing.

      Devbootcamp is aware of the fears and worries of students. I personallly do not enjoy being put under pressure. When I interviewed for DBC, I felt very uncomfortable during the logic puzzle challenge because I had no idea how to do it, and felt the pressure of time against me. What I love about phase 0 is that it allows you to design your DBC schedule flexibly so that while you are still offsite, you may still live your life like a normal person. I truly expect the curriculum to pick up in difficulty in the weeks to come, but feel willing and motivated to charge at it because I know my goals and feel like im on a path. In university, no technical skill or end result was garunteed after graduation but with DBC, I have a clearer vision of the path I heading down and where it may lead.
