        Proper teamwork skills are what I have learned to be an essential part of being a successful programmer. In my experience thus far, I feel I have learned the most about practical programming by working with others on challenges and side projects. Undoubtedly, I think that pairing with others takes me out of my comfort zone of just working on my own and forces me to interact, communicate and collaborate with another person on a challenge. The interaction part of a pairing session sparks in the beginning of the conversation, when I typically check up on my partner, see how their day is going, ask them how they typically understand driver/ navigator roles, and ask a bit of brief background information about them.

        Throughout a pair session, communication is very crucial to success. This means that throughout the challenge, I let me partner know exactly what I am doing and why. There are no gaps in the workflow. Even when researching, we let each other know what we are investigating and how it is going. One of the beauties about working with a partner on the computer is that you may have a conversation with that person while you are working. This allows for very effective multi-tasking that in the end just makes both jobs more fluid and productive.

        In my last pairing challenge, I found the initial introductions to be the most interesting part of our session. I was able to ask some personal questions of my partner, which got us both focused, and on the same level. After this, we were able to talk about how we are enjoying DBC and how we are managing our time during the remote session. Its amazing how great a session can go if you just take the time in the beginning to connect and have a brief talk about how things are going in our day.

        When I read my feedback, I was at first a bit hesitant because I do not like to hear any criticism of how I am as a partner. Sometimes I think this aspect of my character needs to be adjusted more so that I actually want to hear criticism more than praise. When I write feedback, sometimes I find it hard to force criticism if the session went very well. On that same page, I think it is clear that when criticism is clearly warranted, it is essential not to hold it back. I think that when I pair next time, I am going to be more communicative overall throughout the process, as I mentioned earlier, even when I am doing research.
