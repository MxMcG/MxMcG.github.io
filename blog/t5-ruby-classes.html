        During my fifth week as a member of Dev Bootcampâ€™s Phase 0 remote part of the program, I have learned and practiced using Ruby Classes. Ruby classes are an essential tool of the language that are essentially a blueprint from which individual objects are created. I have come to realize that classes are very reminiscent of real-world objects in our daily lives such as cars, instruments, or houses. Just as each of these real-world items have characteristics and functions, so too do classes. For example, a computer mouse had several characteristics such as its shape, its color, and its size. Additionally, a computer mouse has certain functions such as scroll, click and move. All of these internal characteristics mimic the different methods that are all held within a class. As a blueprint for a certain object, such as a computer mouse, a Class may contain a function that defines the functionality of a scroll within a method. A Class is able to hold several methods and variables which all work together to makeup the final goal of the class. Classes are useful in creating diverse objects because parameters are passed into the blueprint in order to create customized objects of any kind. For example, one instance of a computer mouse object may have a certain color or scrolling characteristics based on the parameters that are passed into it.

        There are several aspects of classes that I initially found a bit confusing to grasp at first, however, by partnering up with fellow coders I was able to grasp some crucial traits of classes such as attr_ methods and driver code for classes. The attr_ method is a handy shortcut that enables the creator of a class to define several variables that will be may either be changed or stay constant throughout the code.  This enables us to use either, attr_ reader, attr_writer, or attr_accessor in order to assign variables for use in the class and across different classes. As I continue striving to grasp the concepts of effective Ruby, I know that I will continue to learn more about Classes. They are an important and very useful aspect of the language which I know I am just at the beginning of understanding, but I am confident that as I put more time in, I will learn.
