      <p>Arrays
        In Ruby, we call collections of objects 'arrays'. Arrays are important because they allow programmers to hold, retrieve and manipulate a series of objects in a collection. For example, if you wanted to store a series of magazine articles into a chronological collection, you could do so by storing them in an array. Individual values within an array may be retrieved and deleted. Arrays are stores in ruby between [] brackets and may include integers or strings or both.

      <p>Hashes
        Hashes are similar to arrays, however, they are a collection of key:value combinations. A hash consists of key/ value pairs where any key and any value can be a Ruby object.  Hashes let you perform lookup operations based on keys and allow for complex filtering and selection operations. A typical use of hash would be to store complete strings along with their abbreviations. Hashes also remember the insertion order of their keys, however, this is often not an essentially important aspect of them.

      <p>Arrays vs. Hashes
        Arrays and hashes both allow us to hold objects in collections in organized fashion. An array is an ordered selection of objects ordered in the sense that you can select objects from the collectiond on a consistent, consecutive numerical index. Hashes on the other hand are unordered and store objects in pair, each pair consisting of a key and value. Hashes are very useful for storing and retrieving large amounts of data and information.Overall arrays and hashes are closely related. An array in a sense is a hash where the keys happen to be consecutive integers. Hashes in a sense are arrays where the indexes are allowed to be anything, not just integers. We use hashes and arrays very often in ruby, so its is essential to get familiar with them right now!
