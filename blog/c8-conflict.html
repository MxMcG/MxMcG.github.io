      <h2>Early Stage Conflict in a Startup</h2>
      <h3>How addressing conflicts early helps avoid future damage.</h3>

      <p class="blog-post-p1">
        Conflicts are a part of our daily lives and world, and a large part of making progress in our lives is learning how to understand and work through conflicts. I have always been more of a conflict-avoiding type of person, however, I have realized in recent years that some times it is important to confront areas of conflict in a strategic manner.

      <p class="blog-post-p2">
        One recent conflict that I can think of actually involves a coding workspace. I am a part of an early startup called Tixzoo, and our team currently conists of 4 programmers and one non-technical marketing/ business member. Often times, we members of the technical team feel that we are doing much more work than the non-technical member. While we stay up all night working on code, the non-technical member is often times out at the bar or hanging out with friends. This individual justified his behavior through his lack of technical skill. Basically, because he cannot code, he does not think that he needs to do as much work as us until after the project had been developed. As a group, our technical team would often just vent our frustrations about this member over hangouts, or sometimes talk down/ make fun of him. I eventually realized that this conflict had some deep rrots that were related to how we were functioning as a technical team, and how this non-tech member was carrying out his contribution to the overall project.

      <p class="blog-post-p3">
        Some of the emotions that the technical members felt because of this conflict were frustration, anger and resentment toward the member that was non contributing. The non-tech member was largely oblivious to all the emotions the team was feeling toward him and this is part of the reason that the conflict continued on and on without resolve. It became clearly obvious to me that earlier on in our development cyle, we as a technical team should have made clear some of our frustrations toward this member and not avoided the conflict. Next time, I will try to straight up approach the source of the conflict, call it plainly out in front of everybody so that we may start to brainstorm solutions.
