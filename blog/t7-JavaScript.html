        So Ruby and Javascript are two very useful and dynamic languanges, but what are they used for and how do they differ? Why is JavaScript so well known while Ruby appears newer and less widely known. Ruby turns out to be a language with many similarities with JavaScript. In terms of Object Oriented design, I can already get a sense for how Ruby classes are similar to JavaScript constructor functions. In this post, I am going to track some considerable notes about the difference between these two important languages.

        First, we should loo at how looping is handled in Ruby vs JS. In Ruby, methods do a great job handling iterations and loops. For example, #each or #map allows for built in loop handling. JS uses for, while loops. In JS, the for loop is followed by a strange-at-first 3 argument- parenthese that determines the value of variable, the parameters of the iteration, and finally the actual code of the iteration itself. Ruby hashes were similar to JS objects in that they took two-part values. In Ruby, hashes contain key/value pairs while in JS, objects contain properties and their respective values.

        Both the Ruby and JS documentation appear to be considerably well done in their perspective sites. I think that I am used to the Ruby Docs and therefore feel like it's design is superior to JS on MDN. I think that Ruby is a beautiful language, and my experience with JS thus far is making me appreciate more and more Ruby, however, I l ook forward to delving more into JS and seeing how that makes my mind change.
