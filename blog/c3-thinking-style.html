      <h2>Learning quickly and efficiently in Phase 0</h2>
      <h3>Progress of an abstract sequential learner in Phase 0</h3>
      <h4>7 June 2015</h4>

      <p>Thus far, I have loved my experience with DBC overall and especially in Phase 0. I had some concerns going in that I wouldn't be a good fit for the program, but now after becoming familiar with the routine of the curriculum and video pairing, I am thinking more and more that coding is the right skill for me to learn. Personally, for the past few weeks I have been wrapping up my undergraduate career as a student at UCLA. It has been an interesting challenge working on both finals and phase 0 are has reminded me how serious I am taking my time at DBC. Instead of partying and celebrating all the time like many of my peers, I have been up long hours working on ruby code, or reading about how to style a document with CSS.

      <p>As I look to graduation, I am overwhelmed with the excitement of moving into a more practical technical learning environment that I actually enjoy. While college taught me a lot about myself, It is now time for me to step onto a career path that I can truly grow and be creative within. As an abstract sequential learner, I like to organize my tasks into a linear fashion but when it comes to actually working, my thinking considers many abstract approaches. I have surely noticed the realness of my thinking style during my time thus far at DBC. I typically am very organized with my assignments and time box properly and I have noticed that while I am working on a challenge, I tend to use many non-conventional strategies to solve a problem. I am not particularily comfortable with wandering away from protocol and enjoy following instructions closely. In pairing challenges, I like to take things slow and communicate well and thoroughly with my partner. I do not like there to be any miscommunication, so have learned to be quick to mention any misclarities or questions I may have of my partner.

      <p>Perhaps the most difficult part of Phase 0 for my thus far has been the physical task of sitting at a computer for long periods of time. I often feel a strain on my arm and shoulder muscles after a long day of coding. In order to take action on this problem, I have gotten into the practice of stretching out every half hour and taking breaks to stretch out. Also I try to keep a straight back while I work and use proper typing techniques. In terms of accessories, I have purchased an external mouse, and plan on ordering an external keyboard to help my positioning while I am coding. I typically swim for an hour per day, however, I continue to feel soreness while I work. In the next few weeks I plan on adjusting my working behavior anf habits more closely toward a growth mindset when it comes to preparing physically for my work. I plan on really trying to strengthen and stretch out my muscles and arms often so that I do not obtain injury. Another area that I plan on improving now that I will be done with college is not turning in all my work on Sunday night. I find that if I submit my work on Sunday night, I can become lazy on the last challenge and not put as much effort as I do on others. I plan on time boxing my work into the days of the week and making sure that I have completed my work earlier in the week than I have been. Overall, weeks 1-3 have been great and I feel that I have learned a lot of useful skills. Going into week 4, I plan on stepping up my reading and outside research to really grasp the concepts.
