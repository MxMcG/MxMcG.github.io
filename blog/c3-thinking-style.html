      <h2>Learning quickly and efficiently in Phase 0</h2>
      <h3>Progress of an abstract sequential learner in Phase 0</h3>
      <h4>7 June 2015</h4>

      <img src="#" alt="#"/>

      <p>After finally graduating college form UCLA after a vigorous academic year, I am taking summer in full stride with Phase 0. With no commitments other than Phase 0 work, I have finally had the free time to dive deeper into specific topics and subjects that were frustrating me in earlier weeks. I recently delayed my cohort date in order to do just this... further marinate in the material and polish my CSS skills. Phase 0 has been a huge commitment, and I am amazed with the speed at which we are learning the material. I have confidence in my fellow Cicadas, and the DBC staff to be with me strong throughout this entire journey.

      <p>As an abstract, sequential learner, I have learned how important time boxing has been to help prevent me from wasting time. I find that working in 25 minute increments with stretch breaks in between has been the most effective work strategy for me thus far. Every hour, or two breaks, I fluctuate between standing and sitting so that I may keep my muscles loose and maintain good posture. After working on DBC for a few weeks, I developed pain in my neck from always looking at the computer. The purchase of a desk stand, and a wireless keyboard have me wonders in this past week and I feel more adjusted to my working environment than ever before at this moment!

      <p>Perhaps the most difficult part of Phase 0 for my thus far has been the physical task of sitting at a computer for long periods of time. I often feel a strain on my arm and shoulder muscles after a long day of coding. In order to take action on this problem, I have gotten into the practice of stretching out every half hour and taking breaks to stretch out. Also I try to keep a straight back while I work and use proper typing techniques. In terms of accessories, I have purchased an external mouse, and plan on ordering an external keyboard to help my positioning while I am coding. I typically swim for an hour per day, however, I continue to feel soreness while I work. In the next few weeks I plan on adjusting my working behavior anf habits more closely toward a growth mindset when it comes to preparing physically for my work. I plan on really trying to strengthen and stretch out my muscles and arms often so that I do not obtain injury. Another area that I plan on improving now that I will be done with college is not turning in all my work on Sunday night. I find that if I submit my work on Sunday night, I can become lazy on the last challenge and not put as much effort as I do on others. I plan on time boxing my work into the days of the week and making sure that I have completed my work earlier in the week than I have been. Overall, weeks 1-3 have been great and I feel that I have learned a lot of useful skills. Going into week 4, I plan on stepping up my reading and outside research to really grasp the concepts.
