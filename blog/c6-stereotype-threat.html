      <h2>The unfortuante reality of Stereotypes</h2>
      <h3>How they can be overcome and understood</h3>
      <h4>July 21st, 2015</h4>

      <p class="blog-post-p1">There is perhaps nothing in the workplace, school, or public domain that may have such negative effects as the stereotype threat. This phenomenon is a widely researched part of culture and involves the consistent lower performance of individuals when they are perceived to be subjugated by a particular stereotype. One amazingly shocking study in particular showed that when black male college students were identified during their test by race, they performed lower than when race was not mentioned at all. I think it is amazing how we can create practical uses of these types of social science research in our workplace.

      <p class="blog-post-p2">I personally understand the reality of stereotypes. For me, there is no doubt that are in fact real and have effects. As a student at UCLA, I strongly felt stereotypes being thrown around in several social circles. There were the asian stereotypes, the frat bro stereotypes, the south campus science major stereotypes, ect. In fact, there were stereotypes for just about every societal classification on campus. Now the distinguishing factor that allowed for stereotypes to spread was a lack of people resistant to participate in such talk. In most cases, people tend to be uncomfortable around each other, and bringing up stereotype based jokes is often a way for people to break the ice or identify common opinions with each other. I think that stereotypes help people in a bad way to create identities and bonds with each other because they are commonly held opinions about certain societal groups.

      <p class="blog-post-p3">
        I think that stereotypes are an inherent part of our current human condition, however, I think that individuals are able to make a conscious end to their support of stereotypes if they have the incentive. For example, if a person who previously had a racist stereotype against blacks realizes that this mentality is in fact against his moral understanding of the world, he will begin to actively notice all the places that he was previously commiting this bad behavior. In simpler terms, once a person comes to the realization that stereotypes may be harmful, something may stir in their hearts to want to try and resist and resent them when they are encountered. At DBC, I expect there to be many many threats to create a stereotype when I first meet other people, but being aware that this is a part of how I am inclined to behave, I may consciously make the effort to avert going in that direction. In order to do this, one of the best things I could do is to sit down and get to know someone who I might otherwise have a stereotype of. It is only through my choice of branching out and interacting with people who are perceived to be different that I can come to understand and love them like I really should.
