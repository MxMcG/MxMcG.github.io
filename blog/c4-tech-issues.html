      <h2>Cross browser compatibility</h2>
      <h3>A true test for the dynamic front end developer</h3>
      <h4>9 July 2015</h4>

      <p>One of the most important jobs of a front end web developer is to create code that is compatible with the several different browsers that are available for internet users. Current widely used browsers include internet explorer, safari, firefox, chrome, and least popular of the bunch, good old opera. These browsers are all a bit different in the way they interpret CSS. Some of the most difficult to work with browsers are internet explorer v.6 and v. 7. Programmers have historically been frustrated with IE because it was initially innovative throughout the 1990's, however, when IE 6 was released in 2001, Microsoft had 95% market share and began to stop innovating, basically doing nothing to the browser for 5 years after.
      </p>

      <p>One of the main problems with older browsers such as IE6 was that Microsoft failed to keep up with the competition from Firefox and other browsers, so bugs and security holes came up everywhere. Compared with the other modern web browsers, IE still has many bugs that make developers jobs much more difficult. Fortunately, these older browsers are phasing out. Now, IE 8's usage has even dropped to single-digit percentages for many websites. The newest versions of IE have been greatly improved, and most developers think that the future is bright for these browsers. In the mean time, it is very crucial for front-end developers to spend time learning about cross-browser compatibility, and I plan on doing so more and more as my career develops. For now, Google Chrome remains to be my absolute favorite web browser, especially because it implements the developers tools at the bottom of the page - super helpful for dynamic web development.
