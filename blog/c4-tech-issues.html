      <h2>Tech development for developing regions</h2>
      <h3>The potential life changing impact of technology in developing nations</h3>
      <h4>June 12, 2015</h4>

      <p>I have always thought that the work I am doing at DevBootcamp could really help people in developing countries. Today, cell phone usage in Africa is commonplace, with more than 10.7 million mobile phones in Senegal alone. Mobile technologies are empowering those who were once isolated and transforming the ways they communicate. As the amount of mobile phone useage in developing regions increases, there is a huge potential to transform entire populations into better educated, more informed societies. In terms of possibilities, they seem endless. The use of a simple maps app on a poor farmers mobile phone could empower them to better understand traveling distances, create networks to sell their crops or even get more accurate weather prediction.

      <p>While 75 percent of the world has access to a mobile phone, smartphones make up only 15 percent of the global market. biNu is a platform that allows those with feature phones to have a smartphone-like experience through cloud-based apps and services, providing them with immediate access to email, news, books, health information and social features.

      <p>Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer says, "The number one benefit of information technology is that it empowers people to do what they want to do. It lets people be creative. It lets people be productive. It lets people learn things they didn't think they could learn before, and so in a sense it is all about potential."

      Remarkable new information technologies are unlocking the potential of developing countries in ways that are not only empowering, but revolutionary. As new innovations and new possibilities continue to be presented, the digital future is becoming the digital present. I can't wait to see what's next.
